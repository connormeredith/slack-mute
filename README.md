## Slack-mute

A poorly built Chrome extension to stop Slack from changing its favicon. Great for people with OCD that need to read all messages when they see the favicon notification but want to actually get things done instead.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Check 'Developer mode'
4. Click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the repo
5. Profit
